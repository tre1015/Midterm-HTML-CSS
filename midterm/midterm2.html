		<h2>So what is MamaChari?</h2>
		<p>Yasushi Sakai, a PhD candidate and the lead researcher for the Panasonic collaboration, hopes that he can not only understand the way the bikes work but also how they can be adapted and improved. Furthermore, he strives to see a future where people and technology coexist and influence and respond to one another. In this system, we will better understand the way our mobility modes are used which will also allow us to see what opportunities are missing. The team will study not only the bikes use and incorporation into a western context but also the cultural response to the technology. With these insights combined, we can look to a future solution that might not have been anticipated, but that can seamlessly fit into a culture and fill a need for users, families and city dwellers.</p>
		
		<p>The MIT team planned two workshops with collaborators from Panasonic to test, hack, and adapt the current MamaChari. The first workshop was hosted on February 28, 2018 at the MIT Media Lab.</p>
		
		<p>In this session, the MIT scientists were introduced to the MamaChari, many for the first time. The users remarked as follows:</p>
		
<ul> 
		
		<li><p>The speed limitation is perceivable, which did decrease interest among single men.</p></li>
			
		<li><p>The initial torque, the assist force that kicks in right after your start pedaling, had mixed impressions.</p></li>
			
		<li><p>Some said it felt new and needed to get used to the assist. On the other hand, some reported that it was actually felt safer since the initial pedaling is the most unstable when riding bikes.</p></li>
			
		<li><p>Related to this, compared to normal bikes people found it was easier to ride on unpaved road conditions since the counterforce from the assist mechanism takes account of not only slopes but friction.</p></li>
			
		<li><p>We had comments that the user interface panel was outdated and could be renewed, since it is the most evident interaction point.</p></li>
			
			
</ul>


<h3>Participants were asked the following questions:</h3>			
<ol> 
		
		<li><p>What would you change about this bike?</p></li>
		<li><p>Will it still be called a bike?</p></li>
		<li><p>What is the environment that we use this “bike” in? How do we perceive or simulate it?</p></li>
		<li><p>What kind of mutation will impact the environment?</p></li>
		<li><p>What kind of mutation will be beneficial for the environment?</p></li>
</ol>
